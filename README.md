# Ultimate 7-Day Home Cyber-Challenge

Welcome to your week-long, hands-on journey attacking and defending only your own network, IP and email. By Day 7 you’ll have:

- **7** polished tools or scripts  
- **7** proof artifacts (screenshots, logs, pcaps)  
- A single monorepo that’s easy to share and extend
